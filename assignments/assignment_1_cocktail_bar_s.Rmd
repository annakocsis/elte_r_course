# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
#data
cocktail_dataset <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

cocktail_dataset
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cleaned_cocktail_dataset <- cocktail_dataset %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<b|<br>") %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\b(oz|dash|dashes|drop|drops|bsp)\\b|\\d+\\s*[^a-zA-Z\\s]*\\s*|\\(.*?\\)|r>")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

cleaned_cocktail_dataset
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
list_of_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_dataset %>%
  select(ingredients) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(tolower(ingredients))

list_of_ingredients
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
number_of_unique_ingredients <- nrow(list_of_ingredients)

number_of_unique_ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top_10_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_dataset %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice_max(n = 10, order_by = n)

top_10_ingredients
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
most_ingredients_cocktails <- cleaned_cocktail_dataset %>%
  count(name) %>%
  filter(n == max(n))

most_ingredients_cocktails
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
number_of_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_dataset %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%
  filter(n == 1) %>%
  nrow()

number_of_rare_ingredients
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
list_of_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_dataset %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%
  filter(n == 1)

list_of_rare_ingredients <- list_of_rare_ingredients$ingredients

cocktails_with_rare_ingerdients <- cleaned_cocktail_dataset %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% list_of_rare_ingredients) %>%
  select(name) %>%
  distinct()

cocktails_with_rare_ingerdients
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktails_without_rare_ingerdients <- cleaned_cocktail_dataset %>%
  filter(!name %in% cocktails_with_rare_ingerdients$name) %>%
  select(name) %>%
  distinct()

cocktails_without_rare_ingerdients
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
cocktails <- arrange(cocktail_dataset, tolower(name))$name
ingredients <- list_of_ingredients$ingredients

cheat_sheet <- matrix("", nrow = nrow(cocktail_dataset), ncol = nrow(list_of_ingredients), dimnames = list(cocktails, ingredients))

for (ingredient in ingredients) {
  for (cocktail in cocktails) {
    if (cocktail %in% cleaned_cocktail_dataset$name[cleaned_cocktail_dataset$ingredients == ingredient])
      cheat_sheet[cocktail, ingredient] <- "X"
  }
  
}

cheat_sheet
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
